## Elections
At the end of every Spring semester, a new election is held in order to determine the new set of board members for next year. People who want to be on the board will state what role they want to apply for. They will also submit a short essay on why they want to apply for that role.

## Voting
Only registered members of BFF can vote for the candidates during the election. Voters must supply their e-mail when voting in order to ensure that they vote at most once.

# Training System
## Goal
Allow people to coach each other on certain skills in badminton. Help break the ice between players.

People would express which skills they would like to train on 
* General
* Form
* Clear
* Parry
* Smash
* Drop
* Serve

People would volunteer to coach players.

The system would pair a trainer with a trainee or a trainee with a trainee with complimenting skills (e.g. smash and parry)

Trainers can give a short critique or rating on each trainee

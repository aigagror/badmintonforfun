# Registrations
Registering for BFF requires a set of information
* Name
* Nickname (optional)
* NetID and/or phone number (depending on whether you are a UIUC student or not)
* E-mail address

People register on two tiers: 
1. Interested
2. Membership

## Checking Members
Members should be able to be queried based on name, netID and/or e-mail. Many people try to sneak into our club during playtime, and so it is important to quickly query members.

## Security and Accounts
Create accounts for each user. If users who have already registered are creating an account, they should be able to link their account to their registration (e.g. providing the e-mail that they used to register)
(OAuth login)

## Mailing Lists
BFF has two mailing lists
1. Interested
2. Membership

The point of these two mailing lists is to avoid emailing one group on information, that the other group does not need to know about. For example, an email about the tournament might go to both mailing lists, but an email about available membership spots still remaining would only go to those who registered as interested.

People may choose to unsubscribe from these mailing lists. 
* If a person who is registered as interested unsubscribes, then they are taken off the database ENTIRELY.
* If a person who is a registered member unsubscribes, then they are simply taken off the membership mailing list. They will still be registered as a member for that semester.

# Badminton Ranked Play
*We will reserve one or two courts for ranked play. Participation is OPTIONAL. No one is pressured to play rank.*

## Goal
The goal of this system is to provide a method for matching players of similar skill level while also breaking the ice between people who don’t know each other very well. 

With every type of ranking system, there is also the glory of being at the top amongst your peers.

It is also meant to provide a convenient way for people to keep track and view their own statistics as well as other people’s.

## The System
The System organizes the matches and records the results of each match. The system is only active during play time. During play, people sign into the system with their e-mail whenever they want to participate. People may also sign out at anytime. (Only official members of BFF may participate)

## Pairing
When a court becomes available, the system will generate a pair of players who are signed in. The system will try to match players that are closest in rank, with some degree of randomness. People who have been in the system longer and have not played a match will have a higher priority of being chosen. They decide whether they would like to challenge each other to a match or opt-out of a match. If a player does not respond within a certain time (e.g. 15 minutes), then it is considered an automatic opt-out. 

## What Happens During a Pairing
The following is a list of each scenario when the system has paired two people.

### Both people challenge each other
The pair shall play a match. The winner receives a point towards their “Win” score. The loser gets nothing.

The players, score, and date of the match shall be recorded. 

Only certain players (e.g. board members) can record and submit the result of matches.

### One challenges, the other opts out
The person who challenged receives a point towards their “Feared” score. And the person who opted out gets nothing. 

The date shall be recorded, but the person who opted out will not be in order to prevent any embarrassment. 

### Both Players opt out
Nothing happens and nothing is recorded. 

## After a Pairing has Concluded
Both players are put back into the system’s queue to be paired with another random player. 

## Showing the Rankings
A webpage will display the list of players who were part of the system. 

The webpage should be able to query the players based on their Win score, their Feared score, a given time frame, number of matches, and/or their name.  

## Showing the Games
Matches will be video recorded unless one of the players votes to not record the game. A webpage will show highlights of the game curated by the board members.
